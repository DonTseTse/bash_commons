#! /bin/bash
# This script is not a test in itself but a wrapper to run any of the other tests under a specified user.
#
# It exists because some of the filesystem functions, f.ex. is_writeable(), deliver different results for a same test if the executing user is
# root or another account. The script allows, as root or via sudo, to run a test under another user account. To make sure there's no permission
# problems, it creates a copy of bash_commons in a folder in /tmp, gives write permission to the user and executes the test there. The
# bash_commons copy is then removed.
#
# Parametrization:
#Â $1: name of the collection to test, f.ex. "filesystem"
# $2: name of the user to run the test with, f.ex. "man"

# Refuse symlinks and get the absolute path of the commons directory (this file lies in ./tests/.), load dependancies
